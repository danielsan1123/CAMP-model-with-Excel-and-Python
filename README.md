In this project, I utilized the yfinance library, which is a free Python tool powered by the Yahoo! Finance API. It was a great experience to easily implement data analysis. I developed a visualization comparing the market return (SP500) to daily asset returns (stock prices) and calculated input for the CAPM model which is a risk-free asset rate, generally using 10-year treasury, Beta slope coefficients for daily returns of asset prices, and risk premium rate. I'm particularly excited to work with near historical financial data from the Magnificent 7. You can find my analysis findings in the attached report, and you're welcome to download my Excel and IPYNB files as well. Thank you for stopping by my page!

**CAPM Explanation:**

The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) helps investors estimate the expected return on an asset by considering financial market risks it's and historical asset prices. It guides individuals in understanding the relationship between risk and return using historical data only not the other factors.

**Assumptions:**
1. Efficient Markets: All investors have access to the same information, and stocks are considered to be fairly priced.
2. Linear Investment: Investors make straightforward, singular investment decisions over a specific period.
3. Risk-Free and Beta Assumptions: Investors compare market risks to alternative investment opportunities that are risk-free.
4. Systematic Risk: The model focuses solely on risks that are related to the financial market, while keeping other factors constant.

**Limitations**
1. Market inefficiency happens, and individuals often have asymmetrical information for investing.
2. Market conditions change dynamically, and fluctuations of the past do not represent the future.
3. Unsystematic risk can be diversified away in a well-constructed portfolio, but not all investors may have fully diversified portfolios.
