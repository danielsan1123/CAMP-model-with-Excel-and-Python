**CAPM Explanation:**
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) helps investors estimate the expected return on an asset by considering financial market risks it's and historical asset prices. It guides individuals in understanding the relationship between risk and return using historical data only not the other factors.

**Assumptions:**
1. Efficient Markets: All investors have access to the same information, and stocks are considered to be fairly priced.
2. Linear Investment: Investors make straightforward, singular investment decisions over a specific period.
3. Risk-Free and Beta Assumptions: Investors compare market risks to alternative investment opportunities that are risk-free.
4. Systematic Risk: The model focuses solely on risks that are related to the financial market, while keeping other factors constant.

**Limitations**
1. Market inefficiency happens, and individuals often have asymmetrical information for investing.
2. Market conditions change dynamically, and fluctuations of the past do not represent the future.
3. Unsystematic risk can be diversified away in a well-constructed portfolio, but not all investors may have fully diversified portfolios.
